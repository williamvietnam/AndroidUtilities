### SwiftUI
SwiftUI helps you build great-looking apps across all Apple platforms with the power of Swift — and surprisingly little code. You can bring even better experiences to everyone, on any Apple device, using just one set of tools and APIs.


### What’s new in SwiftUI

##### Navigation API
Leverage programmatic control over your app’s navigation behavior to set its launch state, manage transitions between size classes, respond to deep links, and more.

#### Swift Charts
Visualize data with highly customizable charts that look and feel great across all Apple platforms. Swift Charts uses the compositional syntax of SwiftUI to create views with many possibilities, from line and bar charts to advanced types like stream graphs. Swift Charts also supports VoiceOver to deliver information to all your users.

##### Advanced layout control
Build advanced, reusable layouts to power the design of your app. In addition to VStack and HStack, SwiftUI now offers a new Grid API to simultaneously align views both horizontally and vertically. There’s also a new low-level custom Layout API, giving you full control to build exactly the layout your app needs. And SwiftUI now includes ViewThatFits, which lets you specify multiple variations of a given view and lets SwiftUI automatically choose the one that best fits in the available space.

##### Support for additional components
SwiftUI continues to expand to cover many more existing UI components, like half sheets that slide up over a main view when a user wants to see more information or share sheets that let users take advantage of all the Share Extensions installed on their device. And the multicolumn table API from Mac is now available on iPad, making it easier than ever to present tabular data.

##### Improvements for macOS
Support for windowing on macOS is improved with single, unique windows and new modifiers for window position, size, and resizability. Build menu bar extras with SwiftUI to provide access to your app’s functionality from anywhere on Mac.

##### New Sharing API
The new Transferable protocol makes your data available for the clipboard, drag and drop, and the Share Sheet, which can now be invoked directly using SwiftUI.

##### Better UIKit interoperability
SwiftUI is designed to work alongside other interface frameworks. Now you can easily write custom UICollectionView cells using the declarative syntax of SwiftUI. These custom cells fully integrate with UIKit, providing all the expected functionality, such as swipe actions and cell backgrounds.

##### Widgets on the Lock Screen
Make your widgets look great on the Lock Screen with SwiftUI. Compose beautiful icons, gauges, and other elements to give your users quick information at a glance.
